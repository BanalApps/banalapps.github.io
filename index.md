Welcome to BanalApps!

### Encryptator

[Encryptator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=lu.monks.banalapps.encryptator) is an Android application to secure your data using symmetric encryption algorithms.

The application leverages **AES/GCM** and **ChaCha20/Poly1305** to encrypt the data.

**Argon2Id**, **SCrypt**, and **PBKDF2** are used to create a derived key from a user-provided password.

---

The choice of algorithms and encryption parameters is based on the OWASP Cheat Sheet Series best-practices.

[OWASP Cheat Sheet Series - Password Storage](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Password_Storage_Cheat_Sheet.html)

[OWASP Cheat Sheet Series - Secrets Management](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Secrets_Management_Cheat_Sheet.html#71-encryption-types-to-use)

[OWASP Cheat Sheet Series - Cryptographic Storage](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cryptographic_Storage_Cheat_Sheet.html)

---

A [GitHub repository](https://github.com/BanalApps/Encryptator_Python3) is maintained with Python3 scripts which are compabible with the application for transparency about the encryption process.

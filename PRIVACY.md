BanalApps ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and share your personal information when you use our mobile application ("App"). By using this App, you consent to the collection and use of your information as described in this policy.

## 1. Information We Collect
We collect information about your device and interactions with our App. This includes:
- **Google AdMob:**
  - AdMob, a service provided by Google, collects device identifiers, such as Advertising IDs (Google Advertising ID or IDFA), to serve personalized ads. AdMob also tracks interactions with ads (such as clicks or impressions) and may use location data (if enabled on your device) to serve more relevant ads.
- **Google Play Billing:**
  - If you make an in-app purchase, Google Play Billing collects your payment information, which is processed by Google. We do not directly collect or store any payment data such as credit card numbers. All payment transactions are processed by Google Play.

## 2. How We Use Your Information
We use the information collected for the following purposes:
- To show personalized ads based on your interests and app usage.
- To improve our App and user experience by analyzing user behavior and app performance.
- To process in-app purchases made through Google Play Billing.

## 3. Data Sharing and Disclosure
We do not sell or rent your personal data to third parties. However, we may share information as follows:
- **With service providers:** We may share your data with trusted third-party service providers (e.g., Google AdMob) to help us run our services.
- **As required by law:** We may disclose your information to comply with legal obligations or when required to protect our rights, the safety of our users, or to respond to government requests.

## 4. Third-Party Services
Our App uses third-party services, including Google AdMob for advertisements and Google Play Billing for in-app purchases. These services have their own privacy policies, and we encourage you to review them.

- **Google Play Billing:** Google Play processes payments through its billing system. For more information, refer to the [Google Play Terms of Service](https://play.google.com/about/play-terms.html).

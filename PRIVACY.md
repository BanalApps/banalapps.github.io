**Effective Date:** 2025/02/13

BanalApps ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how third-party services used by our mobile application ("App") collect, use, and share your personal information. By using this App, you consent to the collection and use of your information as described in this policy.  

## 1. Information Collected by Third-Party Services  
Our App does not directly collect any personal data. However, third-party services integrated into our App may collect information, including:  

### **Google AdMob**  
- AdMob, a service provided by Google, may collect device identifiers (e.g., Google Advertising ID or IDFA) to serve personalized ads.  
- AdMob tracks interactions with ads (such as clicks or impressions) and may use location data (if enabled on your device) to serve more relevant ads.  

### **Google Play Billing**  
- If you make an in-app purchase, Google Play Billing processes your payment.  
- We do not collect or store any payment details, such as credit card numbers. All transactions are handled by Google Play.  

For more details, please review Google's policies:

## 2. How Third-Party Services Use Your Information

- Analyzing ad performance and user interactions.  
- Processing in-app purchases through Google Play Billing.  

## 3. Data Sharing and Disclosure  
We do not sell, rent, or directly share your personal data. However, third-party services may share data:  
- **With service providers:** Google AdMob and Google Play Billing may share data with their partners to enhance ad targeting and transaction security.  
- **As required by law:** Google may disclose data to comply with legal obligations, law enforcement requests, or to protect users’ rights and safety.  

## 4. International Data Transfers  
Google’s services operate globally, meaning data may be processed outside your country of residence. Google ensures compliance with international data protection laws through mechanisms like Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs).  

## 5. Data Retention
